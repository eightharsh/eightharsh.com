## Introduction

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. It works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine how important the page is.

The idea is simple: **A page is important if other important pages link to it**.

In this post, we’ll break down the logic and code of the PageRank algorithm with a simple Python implementation.

## Graph Structure

We’ll represent the web using a **directed graph**, where:

- Nodes represent pages.
- Edges represent links from one page to another.

### Example:

Let’s say we have 4 pages — A, B, C, D — with the following links:

- A → B, C  
- B → C  
- C → A  
- D → C  

This can be written as:

```python
graph = {
    "A": ["B", "C"],
    "B": ["C"],
    "C": ["A"],
    "D": ["C"]
}
