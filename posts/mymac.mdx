I recently got a new Mac and had to install a lot of apps and tools to get it set up just the way I like. This is a full list of what I installed — partly for my own future reference, and partly for anyone else out there who might find it helpful.

## Firefox (with custom `about:config` settings)

My browser of choice is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox). I love its flexibility and focus on privacy. I’ve tweaked a bunch of settings in `about:config` to make it snappier and more minimal, while cutting down on telemetry and distractions. It’s lightweight, smooth, and has just enough customization power without being bloated.

I also use some extensions for productivity and privacy, but the real difference comes from the `about:config` tweaks. I’ll probably write a separate post for my full Firefox setup soon.

## Ghostty

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.app) is the terminal I’m currently using. It’s minimal, fast, and integrates well with macOS. I love how clean it looks out of the box, and it still gives you everything you’d expect from a modern terminal. Paired with my Fish + Starship setup, it feels super smooth to use every day.

## Raycast

[Raycast](https://raycast.com) is an absolute must-have for me. It’s like Spotlight but 10x more powerful. I use it to launch apps, manage windows, run scripts, check clipboard history, and even control system settings. It also has a growing library of extensions which makes it even more versatile.

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is the backbone of my setup. I use it to install and manage pretty much every CLI tool I use.

```bash
brew install node
brew install neovim
brew install fish
